                <p>My dearest love,

I just wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for being the best gift life has ever given me. Thank you for being my rock, my partner, and my best friend.

I cherish the fact that you've been with me through all the ups and downs, the laughter and the tears. We've had our fair share of silly fights, but what I love most is that we always want the best for each other. We push each other to grow, to learn, and to become better versions of ourselves.

As we approach our 2-year milestone together, I'm filled with so much joy and gratitude. Our bond has only grown stronger with time, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for us.

Thank you for being my everything. I love you more than words can express.

Forever yours, Priyasmita</p>
